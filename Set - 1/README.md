# SET-1 (Basics of JAVA)

## Compilation Guide
To create all class files, run:
```bash
javac *.java
```

## Practical 1: Distance Converter
**Problem Statement:**
Develop a Java program that prompts the user to enter a distance in meters. Your program should then convert this distance to feet (1 meter = 3.28084 feet) and display the result formatted to two decimal places.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Enter distance in meters: 100
100.00 meters is equal to 328.08 feet.
```

## Practical 2: Cramer's Rule (Linear Equations)
**Problem Statement:**
Write a Java program to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables (e.g., ax + by = e and cx + dy = f). Prompt the user to enter the coefficients a, b, c, d, e, f. Calculate and display the values of x and y using Cramer's rule. Include error handling for cases where the denominator is zero.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Enter coefficients a, b, c, d, e, f for the equations:
ax + by = e
cx + dy = f
Enter a: 1
Enter b: 2
Enter c: 3
Enter d: 4
Enter e: 5
Enter f: 6
x = -4.00
y = 4.50
```

## Practical 3: Vowel Checker
**Problem Statement:**
Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter a single letter (character). Determine whether the entered character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, case-insensitive) or a consonant, and display the result.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Enter a single letter: E
E is a vowel.

Enter a single letter: k
k is a consonant.
```

## Practical 4: BMI Calculator
**Problem Statement:**
Develop a Java application that calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI). The program should ask the user for their weight in pounds and height in inches. Convert these values to kilograms and meters respectively and then calculate BMI.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Enter weight in pounds: 154
Enter height in inches: 70
Body Mass Index is 22.0965
```

## Practical 5: Area of Triangle
**Problem Statement:**
Write a program that takes the lengths of three sides of a triangle as input. Calculate and print the area of the triangle. Ensure that the program validates if the given side lengths can actually form a triangle before calculating the area.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Enter the three sides of the triangle:
Side a: 3
Side b: 4
Side c: 5
The area of the triangle is 6.00
```
